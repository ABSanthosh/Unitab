# WXT + Svelte

This template should help get you started developing with Svelte in WXT.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Svelte](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode).


## ToDo
- [ ] the debounce added to the settings store to save to local storage needs a flag to be able to bypass it for instant saves like adding or removing widgets.
